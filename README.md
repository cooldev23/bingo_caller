# Bingo Caller
Simple Bingo caller I built using Vue for my daughter's bday sleepover

## Not much to it
You will need to download all files, or clone the repository to your local computer.  Then, just open the HTML file in your web browser, and you're ready to play.  Click Start Game button, current number is shown and marked in Called Numbers.  Reset restarts the game, and resets everything back to initial.

### Hope you enjoy it
